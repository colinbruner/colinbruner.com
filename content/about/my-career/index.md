Growing up, I've always enjoyed working (playing) with computers. Ultimately I decided to pursue a career where I could work with computers and solve problems.

## University

Living in Dallas Texas at the time, Oklahoma State University was an easy choice for me to attend school.

I majored in Management Information Systems (MIS), which combined aspects of both business and computer science. Ultimately I preferred the computer science side of it.

### After Graduation

During school, my family moved up to Virgina. After school, I ended up moving to Virginia and staying with them while finding work in the North Virginia (NOVA) area.

As far as technology jobs, this was a great area to be in, and after a few interviews I finally landed my first job at a company in Tyson's Corner VA called FolioFN.

## First Job

The company was a small boutique finance firm and I actually started out working as a temp worker in their financial back office. When I initially joined I expressed interested in moving to the IT/Development side of the company, and within a few months I got the opportunity to transition into a Junior UNIX Administrator role.

We mostly worked with Solaris systems, but were moving towards transitioning to RedHat 7. During my time there I was able to earn my [RHCSA 7][rhcsa] Certificate while working there which helped to spring board me onto my next job.

Most importantly, I was able to meet some good people and make close friends who were getting out of college and beginning work at the same time as me. I've stayed close with them to this day.

While working there we were all hoping for an acquisition, however not until many years later would the company be bought out by Goldman Sachs

## Verisign

I joined the Resolution Operations team at Verisign, which managed thousands of physical servers and thousands more virtual ones deployed on those physical servers across the world.

The two big products for the team were:

- 2 of the 13 [Root Servers][root], a.root and j.root
- DNS resolution for .com and .net (~3m queries a second world-wide)

Joining Verisign, a publicly traded company, was initially very overwhelming. I joined as a contractor-to-hire and was hired on very quickly, something like month 3 of my 6 months.

However, before I officially became a fulltime employee I got to bill for hours spent flying to London for work.

### Travel

As mentioned Verisign has a global presence of datacenters and part of the responsibilities of the team was to upgrade and operate those globally distributed servers.

It wasn't easy work, we often were working 12+ hour days trying to physically rack and stack servers or troubleshoot strange or unique build issues. Ultimately this was where I got a lot of hands on troubleshooting experience and really built out my foundational skills

Given that - it definitely did not detract from the amount of fun we would all still have while out on a "site build" for often 2-3 weeks at a time.

During the 2.5 years I was actively traveling with Verisign I got to visit:

- London
- New York
- Los Angeles
- San Francisco
- Dallas
- Chicago
- Frankfurt
- Madrid
- Amsterdam
- Tokyo (and Kyoto for fun on the in-between weekend)
- Stockholm

Some of those places multiple times, including getting stuck in Amsterdam for a month - which is a story for another time.

I was 26 years old when I started and at the perfect point of my life to travel the world, try new food, and see and experience new things.

## The Beginning

I met my now wife, Reema, during 2019 in Arlington VA. We hit it off immediately and began dating - about a year later the pandemic hit. Thankfully we decided to move in together right as the lock-down was starting. We weathered the worst of it and were officially engaged on November 14th 2020.

## Engagement

Over the course of the next few years we learned more about each other, got to travel together to various places, and met all of our each others extended families - while, of course, planning our wedding for May of 2022.

## The Wedding

The wedding took place just outside of Chicago, close to Reema's family. We decided to make the drive from Virginia with all of our wedding attire and some extra clothes packed for a few weeks, as we were staying with Reema's parents.

The wedding events began on Thursday and we got to experience a traditional Indian Haldi and Mehndi with our families and friends. Friday was the Sangeet a big pary with lots of drinks and dancing.

Finally Saturday and the wedding were here. Although it was a May wedding it was incredibly hot and the forecast hinted at a chance of rain. Thankfully, the rain held off.. but the heat did not - it was unseasonably hot for a May in Chicago.

While the Wedding and Reception ceremonies were inside, the Baraat (a celebratory wedding process with lots of music and dancing while I rode a horse), was not. Despite the heat everyone danced and had a great time as I was escorted on horseback up to the wedding entrance.

The ceremony began shortly after as I walked up to the Mundap (stage) with Reema's parents. Her walking down the aisle while looking at me and smiling will always be one of my most precious memories. As she made it down the aisle to me, we placed garlands around each others heads, began the puja (prayer), and circled a fire together 7 times. And at the end of the ceremony, Reema's sister stole my shoes (a traditional game the wife's sister will play) and had to be bribed to return them.

With my shoes now back in my possession we exited and were offiically married! The rest of the night, after an outfit change, was spent eating, drinking, dancing, and hanging out with friends and family.

## The Move

As 2023 rolled around, after lots of thought and planning, we decided we were going to try and make the move to Chicago.

I was working fully remote, and we wanted to buy a home and raise a family together, and the suburbs of Chicago seemed like a great place to make that happen.

We spent a bit of time looking for a home before finally finding the one, which we were able to buy in May of 2023. We moved in shortly after that and have happily been living here ever since.
